## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Title**: `The Legend of Tuna: Maze of the Mouse `

**Purpose**: `The program will be a new version of T11 The Legend of 
tuna, where instead of the game being a blank screen, the cat will need to escape a maze.`

**Source Assignment(s)**: `T11: The Legend of Tuna: Breath of Catnip`

**CRC Card(s)**:

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue



```
    Sandy: I think it is starting to come together and it's less scary than I thought. At first I was feeling very behind
    and confused but after doing HW 11 I got more clarity on how to break down the program into subtasks. I think 
    creating the subtasks helped me see visualize and see how to go about setting up my function and ect. I feel like I 
    am catching up but now I am worried about starting to code. I worried about getting stuck and not know what to do 
    and fall behind. I don't want my partner to fall behind because of me. I am scared that I am going to get confused 
    again and not know what to do. But I am going to try to be more optimistic when getting stuck on a problem. 
    
    Taylor: I feel neither ahead or behind, but I feel that it would be easy to fall behind
    if we don't continue working on the project as much as we have been. I'm worried that
    I may not be working on my other classes as much as I should be, but that can be fixed
    by using my time more effectively. I'm surprised by how much planning out and breaking 
    down probelems has helped me. For Example, I didn't know exactly how I was going to
    implement boundaries before breaking problems down into subtask. By breaking down how
    our program will function, we have a much more solid plan how boundaries will be 
    implemented, which prevented me from wasting time writing bad code and the code
    that I do write will be much cleaner than if I haven't planned out how it will work.
    I'm feeling optimistic about this project as a whole and believe that we can finish
    on time.

    Sandy- I am pretty condident in completing this assignment but I am also very worried because I am struggling. I am 
    having a hard time with making the NPCs and having

### Reflection

```

```
    Partner 2: Sandy Enriquez Vazquez 
        From the beginning of this project, I knew I wanted to create a game. I’ve recently 
    been more interested in game development because of my game design class. When Taylor 
    suggested the idea of designing a maze game, I was very interested and thought it was a 
    good idea. The concept seemed fun, but I was also a bit worried because I was confused 
    about how we would code the maze, which seemed very difficult. Our project stayed very 
    similar to the initial idea of the game. The main things I remember from our initial idea 
    were the mouse NPC moving away from the player and the enemy NPCs, the player competing 
   against the enemy NPCs to get to the mouse, and the enemy NPCs leaving their pathway to get 
   to the mouse. We decided not to add the enemy NPCs, leaving their pathway to get the mouse. 
        Throughout the process, I learned that I need to speak up more when I have issues and 
   don’t understand what my partner is trying to get at. I also learned that planning out the 
   logic before coding is very important. Although we did spend time planning the logic behind 
   some things, I wish we had spent more time doing this with all of the code. The hardest part 
   of the project was trying to understand exactly what I was supposed to be doing. Sometimes 
   I didn’t understand and ended up doing things incorrectly. It was also hard to figure out the 
   logic behind the Mouse NPC. 
        If I were to do this again, I would spend more time planning out everything for the 
   beginning and making it clearer. Presenting our game in class made me realize that we 
   should’ve made the mouse and player spawning points random to add more variety to the game. 
   I also wish we had used more GUIs to make our game interesting. Overall, I believe Taylor and 
   I worked pretty well. I learned a lot working with him. Miscommunication was challenging because 
   sometimes I misunderstood what we were trying to do.
