## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Title**: `The Legend of Tuna: Maze of the Mouse `

**Purpose**: `The program will be a new version of T11 The Legend of 
tuna, where instead of the game being a blank screen, the cat will need to escape a maze.`

**Source Assignment(s)**: `T11: The Legend of Tuna: Breath of Catnip`

**CRC Card(s)**:

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue



```
    Sandy: I think it is starting to come together and it's less scary than I thought. At first I was feeling very behind
    and confused but after doing HW 11 I got more clarity on how to break down the program into subtasks. I think 
    creating the subtasks helped me see visualize and see how to go about setting up my function and ect. I feel like I 
    am catching up but now I am worried about starting to code. I worried about getting stuck and not know what to do 
    and fall behind. I don't want my partner to fall behind because of me. I am scared that I am going to get confused 
    again and not know what to do. But I am going to try to be more optimistic when getting stuck on a problem. 
    
    Taylor: I feel neither ahead or behind, but I feel that it would be easy to fall behind
    if we don't continue working on the project as much as we have been. I'm worried that
    I may not be working on my other classes as much as I should be, but that can be fixed
    by using my time more effectively. I'm surprised by how much planning out and breaking 
    down probelems has helped me. For Example, I didn't know exactly how I was going to
    implement boundaries before breaking problems down into subtask. By breaking down how
    our program will function, we have a much more solid plan how boundaries will be 
    implemented, which prevented me from wasting time writing bad code and the code
    that I do write will be much cleaner than if I haven't planned out how it will work.
    I'm feeling optimistic about this project as a whole and believe that we can finish
    on time.

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

️**Completion Percentage**: `70 %`

```
    We are confident about completing this project because almost all functionality is in the game we just need to 
    finish up the EnemyNPC and then get the game logic in and we are complete with the project. We are using stratgies
    such as task prioritization, meeting at scheduled times, and limiting time we work on the project so that we must use
    our time effectively.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### Reflection

```
    Taylor: 
   Me and Sandy are both in Intro to Game Design, so I thought that we both would have a good idea on how to navigate 
making a pygame program. Also, I enjoy making games because I enjoy the complexity that comes with game logic. Our 
final design is nearly what I imagined, but the result isn’t as good as I originally imagined. I thought the project 
was going to turn out better than it did; I think it didn't turn out that well because it’s very short because we 
didn’t have time to make multiple levels because we spent all our time just getting the game to work.
    
   Something I realized during this project is making games in pygame is terribly inefficient because there are not any 
shortcuts like there would be in a game engine. I also learned how to actually use github; For a lot of this class I 
didn’t actually know how to utilize github effectively, so working on this project really helped me learn how to use 
github. The hardest part of this project for me was using github, it was rough starting out but I eventually learned and
got more comfortable using github by the end of the project. Knowing what I know now, I would’ve worked much faster and
efficiently, which would allow me to add more to our game such as having multiple levels.
  
   Difficulties I ran into when working with my partner were organization issues. Previously organization was easier because
I always worked on my own projects by myself. It's a lot harder to organize a program when two people are actively 
working on it. I think we would have benefitted by combining our programs more often. Another issue I ran into with 
my working with Sandy was she would make a bunch of code and then, it wouldn't work and due to poor communication from 
both of us, it wasn’t fixed until way after it should’ve been. Even so, working with Sandy was good; We usually met 
multiple times a week outside of class and were productive while meeting. Sandy has a good work ethic and is easy to 
get along with making working with her enjoyable.

    Sandy:
        From the beginning of this project, I knew I wanted to create a game. I’ve recently 
   been more interested in game development because of my game design class. When Taylor 
   suggested the idea of designing a maze game, I was very interested and thought it was a 
   good idea. The concept seemed fun, but I was also a bit worried because I was confused 
   about how we would code the maze, which seemed very difficult. Our project stayed very 
   similar to the initial idea of the game. The main things I remember from our initial idea 
   were the mouse NPC moving away from the player and the enemy NPCs, the player competing 
   against the enemy NPCs to get to the mouse, and the enemy NPCs leaving their pathway to get 
   to the mouse. We decided not to add the enemy NPCs, leaving their pathway to get the mouse. 
        Throughout the process, I learned that I need to speak up more when I have issues and 
   don’t understand what my partner is trying to get at. I also learned that planning out the 
   logic before coding is very important. Although we did spend time planning the logic behind 
   some things, I wish we had spent more time doing this with all of the code. The hardest part 
   of the project was trying to understand exactly what I was supposed to be doing. Sometimes 
   I didn’t understand and ended up doing things incorrectly. It was also hard to figure out the 
   logic behind the Mouse NPC. 
        If I were to do this again, I would spend more time planning out everything for the 
   beginning and making it clearer. Presenting our game in class made me realize that we 
   should’ve made the mouse and player spawning points random to add more variety to the game. 
   I also wish we had used more GUIs to make our game interesting. Overall, I believe Taylor and 
   I worked pretty well. I learned a lot working with him. Miscommunication was challenging because 
   sometimes I misunderstood what we were trying to do.
