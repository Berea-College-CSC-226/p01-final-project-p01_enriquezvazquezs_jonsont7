## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Title**: `The Legend of Tuna: Maze of the Mouse `

**Purpose**: `The program will be a new version of T11 The Legend of 
tuna, where instead of the game being a blank screen, the cat will need to escape a maze.`

**Source Assignment(s)**: `T11: The Legend of Tuna: Breath of Catnip`

**CRC Card(s)**:

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue



```
    Sandy: I think it is starting to come together and it's less scary than I thought. At first I was feeling very behind
    and confused but after doing HW 11 I got more clarity on how to break down the program into subtasks. I think 
    creating the subtasks helped me see visualize and see how to go about setting up my function and ect. I feel like I 
    am catching up but now I am worried about starting to code. I worried about getting stuck and not know what to do 
    and fall behind. I don't want my partner to fall behind because of me. I am scared that I am going to get confused 
    again and not know what to do. But I am going to try to be more optimistic when getting stuck on a problem. 
    
    Taylor: I feel neither ahead or behind, but I feel that it would be easy to fall behind
    if we don't continue working on the project as much as we have been. I'm worried that
    I may not be working on my other classes as much as I should be, but that can be fixed
    by using my time more effectively. I'm surprised by how much planning out and breaking 
    down probelems has helped me. For Example, I didn't know exactly how I was going to
    implement boundaries before breaking problems down into subtask. By breaking down how
    our program will function, we have a much more solid plan how boundaries will be 
    implemented, which prevented me from wasting time writing bad code and the code
    that I do write will be much cleaner than if I haven't planned out how it will work.
    I'm feeling optimistic about this project as a whole and believe that we can finish
    on time.

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

️**Completion Percentage**: `70 - 100%`

**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    Sandy- I am pretty condident in completing this assignment but I am also very worried because I am struggling. I am 
    having a hard time with making the NPCs and having

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ❗User Instructions

In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button 
in PyCharm. 

### ❗Errors and Constraints

Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### ❗Peer Evaluation
[README.md](README.md)
It is important that all members of your team contribute equitably. The peer evaluation is your chance to either 
a) celebrate the great work you all did together as an effective team, or b) indicate to the instructor if a member of
your team did not contribute their fair share. Grades will be adjusted for any team member who is evaluated poorly. Your
commit history will be used as evidence, so make sure you are using git effectively!

### ❗Reflection

Each partner should write three to four well-written paragraphs address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
- How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?

```
    Partner 1: **Replace this text with your reflection

```
    Taylor: 
   Me and Sandy are both in Intro to Game Design, so I thought that we both would have a good idea on how to navigate 
making a pygame program. Also, I enjoy making games because I enjoy the complexity that comes with game logic. Our 
final design is nearly what I imagined, but the result isn’t as good as I originally imagined. I thought the project 
was going to turn out better than it did; I think it didn't turn out that well because it’s very short because we 
didn’t have time to make multiple levels because we spent all our time just getting the game to work.
    
   Something I realized during this project is making games in pygame is terribly inefficient because there are not any 
shortcuts like there would be in a game engine. I also learned how to actually use github; For a lot of this class I 
didn’t actually know how to utilize github effectively, so working on this project really helped me learn how to use 
github. The hardest part of this project for me was using github, it was rough starting out but I eventually learned and
got more comfortable using github by the end of the project. Knowing what I know now, I would’ve worked much faster and
efficiently, which would allow me to add more to our game such as having multiple levels.
  
   Difficulties I ran into when working with my partner were organization issues. Previously organization was easier because
I always worked on my own projects by myself. It's a lot harder to organize a program when two people are actively 
working on it. I think we would have benefitted by combining our programs more often. Another issue I ran into with 
my working with Sandy was she would make a bunch of code and then, it wouldn't work and due to poor communication from 
both of us, it wasn’t fixed until way after it should’ve been. Even so, working with Sandy was good; We usually met 
multiple times a week outside of class and were productive while meeting. Sandy has a good work ethic and is easy to 
get along with making working with her enjoyable.
